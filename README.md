# My Promotional Site

This repository contains code for a website promoting a **Emily Ding's Webpage (Personal Portfolio)**.

There're three `HTML` pages: 
1. `index.html`: main page, including my profile, pictures, projects, contact and stories.
2. `coding-camp.html`: second page, present the coding program what I and my family currently activate in China.
3. `life.html`: a simple gallery based on a little bit `JavaScript` to my personal life.

There're also some internal link: _Profile_, _Contact_, _Projects_ what are connected locally (inside of the main page).

The section of `projects` are related to my projects in some specific subjects what done in iSchool in University of Washington:
1.  _INFO360 Design Thinking_
2. _INFO200 Intellectual Foundations Of Informatics_
3. _INFO201 Technical Foundations_
4. _INFO445 Advanced Database Design, Management and Maintenance_.
